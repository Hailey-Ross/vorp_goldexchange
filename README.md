Black Market Items Buyer

=================================================

Installation :

1 - ensure vorp_fence

2 - add vorp_fence to resources folder

A simple variation of the vendor script to allow sell things in "Black Market"

I did an English version just rename en.lua to config.lua

=================================================

This is heavily based on the beautiful Nerakhon's and Blue's bwrp_animalshelter script menu and location system, I added all the Fence Vendors locations and options to sell stuff there

=================================================

Usage : 

1. Go to a fence vendor location on the map, press (E) to open menu, select items to sell

You can modify items and prices in config.lua
